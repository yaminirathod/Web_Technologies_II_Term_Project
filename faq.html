	<div class="faq-topic-heading">Flights FAQ's</div><br><br>
	
	Q. How do I change my flights?<br><br>
		We have negotiated many different types of agreements with different airlines; thus, the rules and restrictions for exchanges and cancellations vary greatly if allowed at all. When allowed, airlines require that we collect a fee for the exchange plus any difference in fare when necessary. Exchange fees start at $125 USD and go as high as $350 USD. Your exchange agent can tell you when you call.<br><br>
	Q. What is an "E" ticket?<br><br>
		E-tickets, are offered by many major airlines, and allow you to travel without a paper ticket, eliminating the worry of leaving your tickets behind. OneTravel.com offers e-tickets when they are available.<br><br>
	Q. Why are the fares different from other sites?<br><br>
		Airlines practice the marketing concept known as "yield management,"where they sell as many seats as they can at the highest price they can get. It is impossible to pinpoint the cost of any single seat on any given flight.<br><br>
	Q. How do I cancel this reservation?<br><br>
		Most airline tickets issued are non-refundable, and non-transferable. Name changes are not permitted. However, you may be able to exchange your tickets for different dates. Penalty fees apply and not all tickets are changeable. Please call our exchange department for details.<br><br>
	Q. Please quote me a fare.<br><br>
		As airlines fill flights or change fares, our database immediately reflects those changes. Since the fares change frequently we are unable to quote fares via email.<br><br>
	Q. What is a 'return period', and how long is it for OneTravel.com partners?<br><br>
		The ‘return period’ is an amount of time referral traffic from an affiliate partner is ‘tagged’ for that specific affiliate partner. The ‘return period’ for the OneTravel.com Affiliate Partner Program is 90 days.<br><br>

	<div class="faq-topic-heading">Billing & Payments</div><br><br>
	Q. When can I expect my refund?<br><br>
		When a reservation is cancelled the same day it was booked, funds for the Airline portion are not collected. Any pending charges you may have seen would have been a "pending hold" for verification. These funds will return to your available credit and will not reflect as a refund. This process normally takes from 3 - 7 business days, depending on your banking institutions procedures.<br><br>
	Q. I received an email advising of a refund I did not request.<br><br>
		These refunds are typically for seat assignment requests that could not be fulfilled by the Airline or during a quality check if we detected an overcharge. This refund does not affect your airline ticket purchase.<br><br>
	Q. I have duplicate charges for the same trip on my account.<br><br>
		This occurs when multiple Airlines or passengers are booked in a reservation. You will see a charge for each ticket processed separately. Any service fees, taxes or additional services may also show as separate charges with the description of Airline/Taxes and Fees. When added together these amounts should total the amount you were quoted.<br><br>
	Q. I’ve been charged more than what was quoted.<br><br>
		Verify with your bank what company the charges are coming from that have posted. Most tickets issued through OneTravel will have the description of NV or Las Vegas on your statement. If you are certain there are posted duplicate charges from OneTravel.<br><br>
	Q. I do not recognize the charges on my bank statement.<br><br>
		Confirm with your bank whether the charges in question have posted or are pending to your account. At the time of reservation a "pending charge" is placed on your account for the full amount. The bank/credit card company then puts a "hold" on that dollar amount, until the transaction either posts or is cleared. With a successful transaction, the charge will typically post to the account within 2 - 3 business days, at that time the money will be deducted from your account, and the "hold" will be released. At times the "pending hold" can show on your account after the charge has posted. Please allow time for the "pending hold" to return to your available credit. This is dependent on your banking institutions policies.<br><br>

	<div class="faq-topic-heading">Car FAQ's</div><br><br>
	Q. I made a car reservation on-line, do I get a confirmation voucher?<br><br>
		All on-line bookings of car rental services will generate a confirmation number assigned by the car rental firm. Please take a copy of your booking confirmation email with you for check in. OneTravel.com does not issue any vouchers to confirm car rental reservations.<br><br>
	Q. What are the age requirements to rent a car?<br><br>
		In the United States, most car rental companies have a minimum age of 25 or above. There are exceptions, but the renter must pay a surcharge. In Europe, foreign driver restrictions vary from country to country. Drivers need to be a minimum of 18 in most countries and have a valid US drivers license. Please check the official website of the rental company. These sites generally have age restrictions posted there, as well as information regarding seat belt laws, child seat requirements, and speed limits.<br><br>
	Q. How do I pay for the car rental?<br><br>
		Generally a credit card is required to secure a car. Many car rental companies will not accept a Debit card, cash for payment or 3rd party credit cards as payment. Check with the individual car company for their policies. All rates are quoted and guaranteed in US Dollars.<br><br>
	Q. What do I need in order to pick up a car?<br><br>
		Print or email the online confirmation from OneTravel.com. This confirmation number from the car rental company is all that is needed, other than a valid driver's license and a major credit card. We do not recommend using debit-cards to pay for car rentals. Some car rental companies may also require a good driving record as a pre-requisite to rent a car and proof of insurance. They may check this at the time of rental, when the actual rental agreement is completed.<br><br>
	Q. Do I need an international driver permit?<br><br>
		It isn't required, but it can't hurt. It costs approximately $20 USD to purchase an International Driver's Permit (IDP), which is simply a translation of a valid U.S. driver's license. This document can prevent a lot of problems for clients driving abroad, especially if they are driving in a country where they don't speak the language, or in a non-tourist area. Per the U.S. State Department only two companies are allowed to issue IDPs.<br><br>
	Q. What does the collision insurance cover?<br><br>
		Coverage is provided to You, provided You and Your Traveling Companions are licensed drivers, and are listed on the rental agreement. Coverage is not available to residents of Texas and Oregon. This benefit does not apply to cars rented in Jamaica, Republic of Ireland, Northern Ireland and Israel. OneTravel recommends taking a copy of the policy coverage along with you to the rental car company.<br><br>

	Q. What is an Australian ETA and am I eligible to get it?<br><br>
		An Australian ETA is equivalent to a visa, but there is no stamp or label in your passport, and there is no need for you to visit an Australian diplomatic office to submit an application. U.S. and Canadian citizens and about 25 other nationalities can take advantage of Australia's new use of technology for immigration clearances. Click here to start processing an Australian ETA.<br><br>
	Q. I have an urgent need for a Passport, what can I do?<br><br>
		Passport processing can be expedited based on the requirements. Once all documents are received, “Rush” services apply when 3 - 10 business days are available for the processing, whereas “Emergency” services apply when 1-2 business days, or less, are available.<br><br>
	Q. What are the fees associated with Visa and Passport processing?<br><br>
		The cost of services usually comprises of government/document issuing fees, delivery charges, rush surcharges (if any), our service fees and foreign national surcharges.
		- Government/document issuing fees refer to foreign consular fees or U.S. Passport Agency fees
		- Foreign national surcharges are added for all travelers who are non-U.S. citizens. A research fee for providing forms and requirements will be charged for all travelers residing outside the U.S.<br><br>

	<div class="faq-topic-heading">Secured Flight Passenger Data</div><br><br>
	Q. What is Secure Flight?<br><br>

		• Facilitate passenger air travel
		• Protect individuals' privacy<br><br>

		This is a unique number the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) assigns to a passenger who have been previously identified for screening at the airports.<br><br>
	Q. If the name printed on my boarding pass is different than what appears on my government ID, will I still be able to fly?<br><br>
		The name you provide when booking your travel is used to perform the watch list matching before a boarding pass is ever issued. You should ensure that the name provided when booking your travel matches the government ID that you will use when traveling.<br><br>
